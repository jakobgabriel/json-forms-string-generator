# String Generator - Electron App

## App Purpose

Since most of the common used applications during the daily life are not able to create general and self defined user input fields, this small desktop application was build, to enable the ability of structured, more user friendly and self defined user data input. It should enhance the functions of other applications that are not able to provide self defined user input fields.

The App currently contains three sections: 

1. The default section is the overview over the currently available JSON Schemas with a list view on the left side, where the schema can be selected

2. The second section is the Create New JSON Schema and UI Schema section, where you can add an additional schema 

3. The third section is the App settings section where currently the global settings of the separator is added (will be changed in the future)

### Create a New JSON Schema and UI Schema

When a new JSON Schema needs to be created, the `Add` Button on the left side will open a dialoge where the `name`, the `JSON schema` and the `UI schema` can be defined. If help is necessary for the definition of the Schemas, you can visit the [jsonforms documentation](https://jsonforms.io/), by clicking the `information` button.
