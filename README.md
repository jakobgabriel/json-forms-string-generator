# String Generator - Electron App

## App Purpose

Since most of the common used applications during the daily life are not able to create general and self defined user input fields, this small desktop application was build, to enable the ability of structured, more user friendly and self defined user data input. It should enhance the functions of other applications that are not able to provide self defined user input fields.
